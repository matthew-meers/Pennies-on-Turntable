# Pennies-on-Turntable
Animation represents pennies arranged radially on a turntable.  The coefficient of friction between the pennies and the turntable can be changed as well as the angular frequency of the turntable.  Based on those parameters a maximum radius from the center of the turn table is drawn where all pennies closer to the center of the turntable will stay on while all pennies further from the center will slide off (marked green and red respectively).
